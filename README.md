## case_study : Search Algorithm Relevance
### Data :
Data consists of samples from 5 algorithms in .csv format.
The .csv files contain observations of searches
(1 row = 1 search), the number of returned
results and the rank of the clicked result. A rank
of 0 means that no result was clicked.
#### It is important to get good search results on top while keeping searches without result (clicked result) on reasonable margins.

### Task 1:
Evaluate the given data to determine the “best”
algorithm. Choose and create metrics
appropriate for the task. Report as
many metrics as to share the thoughts
and can find and describe differences in the
outcome. Also, involves using descriptive
statistics and visualizations to guide through the exploration.

### Task 2:
Answer the following questions:
- How to determine whether two words or
phrases are synonyms?
- In general, how do you find relationships
to use for query expansion?
- What are the trade-offs between using
click-through rate (CTR) and conversion
rate as search success metrics?!

##### Concluding remarks on Natural Language Search and it's applications.
